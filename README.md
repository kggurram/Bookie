# COE528 Project

A bookstore application implemented using JavaFX amongst others.

## Use Cases

Admin usage of the app:    

Admin can login with admin/admin credentials. This presents a screen welcoming the admin and some options. Depending on the option selected the admin has the power to add or delete a selected book as well as add or delete a selected customer. Of course he is given the option to go back to the previous screen or log out as well.

Customer usage of the app:

A customer can only login with existing credentials; they would have to register with the admin beforehand (ie. not required, therefore not implemented). Once logged in, the customer can see 

    [WORKS ONLY FOR 1 SELECTION AT A TIME] [Buy] button works

    [NOT WORKING] [Redeem Points and Buy] button works

    [WORKING] [logout] button works

(iii) On closing the window by clicking

    [WORKING] app saves info to two files books.txt and customers.txt properly

(iv) On re-run of the app, the data from files

    [WORKING] books.txt and customers.txt are re-loaded properly
